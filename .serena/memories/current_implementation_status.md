# Current Implementation Status

Based on PLAN.md analysis, the project is in advanced stages:

## Completed Phases ‚úÖ
- **Phase 1**: Core Foundation (Error handling, Database layer, Process representation)
- **Phase 2**: Configuration System (Global config, Project config, Environment management)
- **Phase 3**: Process Management (Process manager, Process monitoring)
- **Phase 4**: Scheduling & Auto-shutdown (Inactivity tracking)
- **Phase 5**: Most of Interfaces (CLI, Daemon server, Process logging, System logging, Most of MCP server)

## Current Status üöß
- **Phase 4**: Health Monitoring (`scheduler/health.rs`) - ‚è≥ PENDING
- **Phase 5**: MCP Server - Activity tracking integration tests - ‚è≥ PENDING  
- **Phase 6**: Integration & End-to-End Testing - ‚è≥ PENDING

## Key Architecture Components
The codebase includes:
- SQLite database layer with migrations and queries
- Process management with lifecycle operations
- Environment activation/deactivation system
- Daemon server with Unix socket communication
- MCP server implementation with rmcp 0.2.1
- CLI interface with comprehensive commands
- Structured logging with JSON Line format
- Activity tracking and auto-shutdown

## Database Implementation
The project has a complete database layer:
- `database/schema.rs`: Database schema definitions
- `database/migrations.rs`: Database migrations
- `database/queries.rs`: Database operations
- `database/mod.rs`: Module exports

This provides SQLite-based persistence for:
- Process state and metadata
- Environment configurations
- Activity tracking for auto-shutdown
- Process logs and history
