# Runcept

**Run + Intercept** - A powerful Rust-based process manager that intelligently manages long-running processes with both AI assistant integration and command-line interface capabilities.

## Overview

Runcept simplifies development workflow management by providing:
- **Project-based process orchestration** with dependency management
- **Intelligent auto-shutdown** to save system resources
- **AI assistant integration** via Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Comprehensive logging and monitoring**
- **Cross-platform support** (Linux, macOS; Windows support planned)

Perfect for managing complex development environments with multiple services, databases, and background processes.

## Key Features

### üöÄ Process Management
- **Smart orchestration**: Start, stop, restart, and monitor processes with dependency resolution (in theory)
- **Health monitoring**: HTTP, TCP, and command-based health checks
- **Auto-restart**: Configurable automatic restart on process failure (in theory)
- **Graceful shutdown**: Proper signal handling and cleanup

### üìÅ Project-based Configuration
- **`.runcept.toml` files**: Define all project processes in a single configuration
- **Environment activation**: One command to start/stop entire development environments
- **Working directory management**: Flexible path resolution and environment variables

### ‚ö° Resource Management
- **Inactivity timeout**: Automatically stop unused processes to save resources
- **Activity tracking**: Monitor process usage and optimize resource allocation
- **Persistent state**: SQLite database ensures process state survives restarts

### ü§ñ AI Integration
- **MCP Server**: Native support for AI assistants (Claude, etc.)
- **Intelligent management**: AI can start, stop, and monitor your development environment
- **Context-aware**: AI understands your project structure and dependencies

### üõ†Ô∏è Developer Experience
- **Rich CLI**: Intuitive command-line interface with comprehensive process control
- **Real-time logs**: Request process logs with limits (more to come)
- **Cross-platform**: Works seamlessly on Linux and macOS (Windows support in development)
- **High performance**: Built with Rust for speed and reliability

## Architecture

The project is structured into modular components:

- `process/`: Core process management and storage
- `config/`: Configuration management and project activation
- `mcp/`: MCP server implementation with process management tools
- `cli/`: Command-line interface
- `database/`: SQLite database for process persistence
- `error.rs`: Centralized error handling

- `-e, --environment <PATH>`: Specify environment path (defaults to current directory)

## Configuration

### Basic Project Setup

Runcept uses `.runcept.toml` files to define your project's processes. Here's a complete example:

```toml
[project]
name = "my-web-app"
description = "Full-stack web application development environment"
inactivity_timeout = "30m"  # Auto-shutdown after 30 minutes of inactivity

[[process]]
name = "database"
command = "postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres"
working_dir = "."
auto_restart = true
health_check = "tcp://localhost:5432"
health_check_interval = "10s"

[[process]]
name = "redis"
command = "redis-server"
working_dir = "."
auto_restart = true
health_check = "tcp://localhost:6379"

[[process]]
name = "web-server"
command = "python manage.py runserver"
working_dir = "."
env = { DEBUG = "true", PORT = "8000", DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://localhost/myapp" }
auto_restart = true
health_check = "http://localhost:8000/health"
depends_on = ["database", "redis"]  # Start after database and redis

[[process]]
name = "worker"
command = "celery worker -A app.celery"
working_dir = "."
depends_on = ["redis", "database"]
auto_restart = true

[[process]]
name = "frontend"
command = "npm run dev"
working_dir = "./frontend"
env = { NODE_ENV = "development" }
depends_on = ["web-server"]
```

## Usage

### Environment Management

```bash
# Initialize a new project
runcept init                    # Creates .runcept.toml template

# Environment lifecycle
runcept activate               # Start all processes in dependency order
runcept deactivate            # Stop all processes gracefully
runcept status                # Show environment and process status

# Quick project switching
runcept activate /path/to/other/project  # Activate different project
```

### Process Management

```bash
# List and inspect processes
runcept list                   # List processes in current environment
runcept ps                     # List all processes across environments
runcept status                 # Show environment and process status

# Process lifecycle
runcept start web-server       # Start specific process
runcept stop web-server        # Stop specific process gracefully
runcept restart web-server     # Restart process

# Cross-environment process management
runcept start web-server -e /path/to/project    # Start process in specific environment
runcept stop web-server -e /path/to/project     # Stop process in specific environment
runcept restart web-server -e /path/to/project  # Restart process in specific environment

# Emergency operations
runcept kill-all              # Stop all processes in all environments
```

### Log Management

```bash
# View logs
runcept logs web-server        # Show recent logs
runcept logs web-server -n 100   # Show last 100 lines
runcept logs web-server --lines 100  # Show last 100 lines (alternative)

# Cross-environment logs
runcept logs web-server -e /path/to/project  # Get logs from specific environment

# Note: Follow mode (-f, --follow) is defined but not yet implemented
```

### Daemon Management

```bash
# Daemon control
runcept daemon start          # Start runcept daemon in background
runcept daemon start -f       # Start daemon in foreground
runcept daemon start --foreground  # Start daemon in foreground (alternative)
runcept daemon stop           # Stop daemon gracefully
runcept daemon status         # Check daemon status
runcept daemon restart        # Restart daemon
```

## AI Assistant Integration (MCP)

Runcept provides native integration with AI assistants through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

### Setup MCP Server

```bash
# Start the MCP server (usually done automatically)
runcept mcp

# Or configure in your AI assistant's MCP settings
# Server command: runcept mcp
# Server args: []
```

### Available MCP Tools

### Example AI Interactions

```
You: "Start my web development environment"
AI: *uses activate_environment tool to start your project*

You: "The web server seems slow, check its logs"
AI: *uses get_process_logs to retrieve and analyze web-server logs*

You: "Restart the database and check if the web server is healthy"
AI: *uses restart_process for database, then checks web-server health*
```

## Examples

### Web Development Stack

```toml
[project]
name = "fullstack-app"
description = "React + Node.js + PostgreSQL development environment"
inactivity_timeout = "45m"

[[process]]
name = "postgres"
command = "postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres"
working_dir = "."
auto_restart = true
health_check = "tcp://localhost:5432"

[[process]]
name = "backend"
command = "npm run dev"
working_dir = "./backend"
env = { NODE_ENV = "development", DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://localhost/myapp" }
depends_on = ["postgres"]
health_check = "http://localhost:3001/health"

[[process]]
name = "frontend"
command = "npm start"
working_dir = "./frontend"
env = { REACT_APP_API_URL = "http://localhost:3001" }
depends_on = ["backend"]
```

### Microservices Environment

```toml
[project]
name = "microservices"
description = "Microservices development environment"

[[process]]
name = "redis"
command = "redis-server"
working_dir = "."
health_check = "tcp://localhost:6379"

[[process]]
name = "user-service"
command = "python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001"
working_dir = "./services/user"
depends_on = ["redis"]
health_check = "http://localhost:8001/health"

[[process]]

command = "node server.js"
working_dir = "./gateway"
depends_on = ["user-service", "order-service"]
health_check = "http://localhost:8000/health"
```

## Platform Support

### Supported Platforms
- ‚úÖ **Linux**: Fully supported and tested
- ‚úÖ **macOS**: Fully supported and tested
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Windows**: In development (use WSL2 as workaround)

### Windows Status
Windows support is currently incomplete due to platform-specific dependencies:
- Process management relies on Unix process groups and signals
- IPC uses Unix domain sockets (though Windows named pipes are partially implemented)
- Signal handling (SIGTERM/SIGKILL) needs Windows equivalents

**Windows users** can use WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) to run runcept with full functionality.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Process won't start:**
- Check if the command is available in PATH
- Verify working directory exists
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Review process logs: `runcept logs <process-name>`

**Health checks failing:**
- Ensure health check URL/port is correct
- Check if process is actually listening on expected port
- Verify health check endpoint returns 200 status
- Increase health_check_interval if process is slow to start

**Dependency issues:**
- Check dependency names match process names exactly
- Verify there are no circular dependencies
- Use `runcept status` to see dependency resolution order

**Permission errors:**
- Ensure runcept has permission to execute commands
- Check file permissions on scripts and executables
- Verify working directory permissions

### Getting Help

- Check logs: `runcept logs <process-name>`
- Daemon status: `runcept daemon status`
- Verbose output: `runcept --verbose <command>` or `runcept -v <command>`
- List all processes: `runcept ps`
- Environment status: `runcept status`
